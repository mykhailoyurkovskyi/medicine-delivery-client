Hi! This is medicine-delivery-client!

This app is written in React js using typescript and tailwind for CSS styles.

Set the correct port as the API uses Cors. The client receives data from the server, but uses only one endpoint to receive all medications.
Also configure the Google Map API key.

This app has 3 main pages - Home, Product Details, Checkout 

npm i - install all packages
run project - npm start

Good luck in testing :)
